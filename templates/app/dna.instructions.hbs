If you want the UI to work, you must include the profiles zome in one of your DNAs. Usually you want to include it in the DNA that everyone joins at first when installing the app. You only need to include it in *one* of the DNAs of the hApp.

Do you want the profiles zome to be installed in the DNA you just scaffolded?

If you do, scaffold the profiles zome in this DNA by running these commands:

  hc-scaffold zome profiles --coordinator dnas/{{dna_name}}/zomes/coordinator --integrity dnas/{{dna_name}}/zomes/integrity
  rm -rf dnas/{{dna_name}}/zomes/coordinator/profiles
  rm -rf dnas/{{dna_name}}/zomes/integrity/profiles
  head -n -5 Cargo.toml > Cargo.tmp && mv Cargo.tmp Cargo.toml
